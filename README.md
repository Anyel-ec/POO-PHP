# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Project in PHP

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project in PHP! This project is designed to provide a deep understanding of fundamental OOP concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. The project structure is organized into three main folders: `abstraction`, `inheritance`, and `polymorphism`.

## Project Contents

### 1. Folder: `abstraction`

In this section of the project, we focus on the principle of abstraction. Here, you'll find files that explain:

- **Abstract Classes:** Definitions of classes that cannot be instantiated directly but serve as templates for concrete classes.

- **Abstract Methods:** Functions within abstract classes that must be implemented by child classes.

### 2. Folder: `inheritance`

The `inheritance` folder centers around the concept of inheritance in OOP. Files here provide information on:

- **Base and Derived Classes:** Examples of how a class can inherit properties and behaviors from another.

- **Method Overriding:** The ability of a derived class to provide a specific implementation for a method already defined in the base class.

- **Protected Methods and Properties:** How to use access modifiers to control the visibility of methods and properties.

### 3. Folder: `polymorphism`

The last section, `polymorphism`, explores the concept of polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly. Here, you'll find information on:

- **Method Overloading:** The ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

- **Method Polymorphism:** How a method can behave differently based on the class of the object calling it.


To run this project, simply clone the repository and explore each folder separately. Each file contains examples and explanatory comments to facilitate understanding of OOP concepts in PHP.
